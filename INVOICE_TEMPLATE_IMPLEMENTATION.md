## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure
The invoice template uses the following data structure:

```php
$invoice = ManagementFeeInvoice {
    invoice_number: "AMC2025-118"
    apartment: Apartment { number: "202/1/1/B" }
    owner: User { name: "K.G.G.Fernando" }
    area_sqft: 2915.73
    management_fee_ratio: 14.00
    sinking_fund_ratio: 2.50
    quarterly_management_fee: 122460.66
    quarterly_sinking_fund: 21867.98
    total_amount: 144328.64
    due_date: "2025-04-15"
    status: "pending|paid|overdue"
}
```

### Calculation Logic
1. **Management Fee**: `area_sqft × management_fee_ratio × 3 months`
2. **Sinking Fund**: `area_sqft × sinking_fund_ratio × 3 months`
3. **Late Fee**: `2% monthly surcharge for overdue invoices`
4. **Total Amount**: `Management Fee + Sinking Fund + Late Fee - Discount`

### PDF Generation
- **Library**: DomPDF (already installed via Composer)
- **Paper Size**: A4 Portrait
- **Styling**: Embedded CSS for consistent rendering
- **Fonts**: System fonts for universal compatibility

## Business Rules Implementation

### Payment Terms
- **Due Period**: 14 days from invoice date
- **Late Fee**: 2% monthly surcharge after 14 days
- **Facility Restrictions**: After 30 days of non-payment
- **Reconnection Fee**: Rs. 4,000.00 for facility restoration

### Communication Channels
